<p> Cricket is my favourite sport as there is always suspense remaining in the game at all times.It is played with a bat and ball and some stumps, There are teams of 11 players each and an umpire for taking calls . The toss decides who bats or balls first.Players decid eit based on the condition of the pitch.The team that bats first scores as many runs as possible . The team batting second wants to score 1 more run than the team batting first . If the scores are equal then its tied.There are three formats - Test cricket ODI and T20I's.test cricket s played over a course of 5 days.ODI is played over 50 overs and T20 is played over a period of 20 overs.
